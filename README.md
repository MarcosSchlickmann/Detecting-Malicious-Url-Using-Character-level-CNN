# Detecting-Malicious-Url-Using-Character-level-CNN
The model combines the characteristics of URLs in the field of web attacks at the character level so that it can detect all kinds of malicious URLs that appear outside of the keyword library. The proposed model treats URLs, file paths, and registries as a short string and uses character-level embedding and a convolutional neural network to simultaneously extract features and classifications. The main highlight of this proposed system is that it doesnâ€™t require manual extraction of features as it was in the case of machine learning models.
